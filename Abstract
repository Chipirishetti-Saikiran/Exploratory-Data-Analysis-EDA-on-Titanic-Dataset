Abstract
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic and their survival status. EDA is an essential first step in any data science or machine learning project as it helps in understanding the structure of the data, detecting anomalies, identifying patterns, and gaining insights. This report provides an overview of the methods used, frameworks employed, advantages and disadvantages of EDA, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
