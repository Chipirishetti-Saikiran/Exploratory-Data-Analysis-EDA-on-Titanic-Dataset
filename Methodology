Methodology
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
Objective: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and explore its basic structure.
Steps:
Load the dataset using pandas.read_csv().
Inspect the data structure using df.info() and df.describe().
Check for missing values and data types with df.isnull().sum().
2. Univariate Analysis
Objective: Analyze each individual feature to understand its distribution.
Steps:
Categorical Features (Sex, Embarked, Pclass): Used bar plots to understand the distribution and proportions within categories.
Numerical Features (Age, Fare): Visualized the distribution using histograms and box plots to detect outliers, skewness, and general trends.
3. Bivariate Analysis
Objective: Investigate relationships between two variables, particularly survival rate.
Steps:
Survival by Gender and Class: Used bar plots to observe the survival rate across gender and passenger class.
Survival by Age and Fare: Scatter plots were used to analyze survival trends based on age and fare.
4. Missing Data Handling
Objective: Address any missing data to avoid bias.
Steps:
Missing values were identified and imputed for features such as Age and Fare using mean/median imputation.
Features with a high percentage of missing values, such as Cabin, were dropped.
5. Feature Engineering
Objective: Generate new features to enhance model performance.
Steps:
Created a new feature Title extracted from the Name column (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss).
Created Family Size by combining the SibSp and Parch columns.
Categorized Age into age groups (e.g., Child, Adult, Senior).
6. Outliers Detection
Objective: Detect and handle outliers to ensure accurate analysis.
Steps:
Identified outliers in numerical features like Fare using box plots and decided whether to keep or handle them.
7. Visualization
Objective: Use visualizations to summarize the findings.
Steps:
Used bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots to visualize the relationship between survival and various features.
Created a correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between numerical variables.
