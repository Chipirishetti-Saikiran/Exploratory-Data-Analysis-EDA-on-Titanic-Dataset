Key Insights:
Survival Rates:

Gender: Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
Class: Passengers in first class had a higher survival rate than those in second and third class.
Age: Children had a higher survival rate, whereas older adults had lower survival chances.
Missing Data:

The Cabin feature had many missing values, leading to its exclusion from analysis.
Age and Fare had some missing values, which were imputed with the mean or median.
Outliers:

The Fare feature had a few extreme values, identified using box plots. However, these values were not removed as they might represent genuine data points (e.g., first-class tickets).
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features like Title and Family Size could enhance the predictive power of models in the next stages of the project.
